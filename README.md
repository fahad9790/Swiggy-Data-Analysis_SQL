## Database Setup
```sql
CREATE DATABASE Swiggy_db;
```
-- 1. Creating Tables
```sql
create table customers (
    Customer_id int primary key,
    Customer_name varchar(30),
    Reg_date date
);

Create table restaurants (
	Restaurant_id int primary key,
    Restaurant_name varchar(55),
    City varchar(30),
    Opening_hours varchar(55)
);
create table orders(
    Order_id int primary key,
    Customer_id int ,
    Restaurant_id int,
    Order_item varchar(55),
    Order_date date,
    Order_time time,
    Order_status varchar(30),
    Total_amount float,
    foreign key (Customer_id) references customers (Customer_id),
    foreign key (Restaurant_id) references restaurants (restaurant_id)
);

create table riders(
    Rider_id int primary key,
    Rider_name varchar(30),
    Sign_up date
);
create table deliveries(
    delivery_id int primary key,
    order_id int ,
    delivery_status varchar(35),
    delivery_time time,
    rider_id int,
    foreign key (order_id) references orders(order_id),
    foreign key (rider_id) references riders(rider_id)
);
```
## Data Import

## Data Cleaning and Handling Null Values
```sql
select * from customers
where customer_name is null or reg_date is null;

select * from restaurants
where Restaurant_name is null or city is null or Opening_hours is null ;

select * from orders
where customer_id is null or Restaurant_id is null or Order_item is null
or order_date is null  or order_time is null or Order_status is null  or
Total_amount is null  ;

select * from riders
where rider_name  is null or sign_up is null;

select * from deliveries
where order_id  is null or delivery_status is null or delivery_time is null or rider_id is null;
```
## Feature Engineering
```sql
set sql_safe_updates=0;

Alter table orders 
add column Time_of_Day varchar(20);

Update orders 
set time_of_day =(
                 case 
                    when order_time between "00:00:00" and "12:00:00" then "Morning"
					when order_time between "12:01:00" and "16:00:00" then "Afternoon"
					else "Evening"
				  end );
                  
Alter table deliveries
add column Time_of_Day varchar(20);

Update deliveries 
set time_of_day =(
                 case 
                    when delivery_time between "00:00:00" and "12:00:00" then "Morning"
					when delivery_time between "12:01:00" and "16:00:00" then "Afternoon"

## Key Insights 

 • Peak Ordering Time: Most orders are placed between 4 PM– 6 PM, while 2 AM – 4 AM sees minimal activity.

 • Top Customers: Customer id 1187,1869 placed over 5  orders each with an average order value of ₹400–₹600.

 • Seasonal Trends: Winter has the highest dish sales, while Spring has the lowest, indicating seasonal food demand.
 
 • Top-Selling Items by City: Dishes like vada Pav ,Pani puri , Fish Fry , Mutton curry and Masala Dosa are best-sellers across major cities.
 
 • High Non-Deliveries: Restaurant id 573,1690,1884 show the highest non-delivery rates.

 
## Actionable Recommendations

 • Introduce Late-Night Offers: Encourage more orders during 2 AM – 4AM with special discounts or combos.
 
 • Reward Loyal Customers: Launch a VIP program or exclusive deals for high-frequency users to boost retention
 
 • Plan Seasonal Campaigns: Launch season-specific menus or offers during Winter, and create Spring discounts to balance demand.
 
 • Promote Best-Selling Dishes: Use regional best-sellers in targeted ads and bundled offers to drive repeat sales.
 
 • Improve Restaurant Reliability: Audit and support restaurants with high non-deliveryrates to reduce cancellations.
